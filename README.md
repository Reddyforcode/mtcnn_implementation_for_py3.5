# MTCNN_face_detection_and_alignment

## About

  This is an adaptation for Python 3.6.9 from https://github.com/YYuanAnyVision/mxnet_mtcnn_face_detection

  (i just change a few lines xD but because the original doesn't run in my enviroment... this is for gpu using cuda)


  Create an enviroment with python 3.6.9 
  ```
  conda create --name myenv
  
  source activate myenv
  
  pip install mxnet-cu101

  pip install opencv-python

  ```

  python main.py -> just draw a box and the landmarks for each face# mtcnn_implementation_for_py3.5
